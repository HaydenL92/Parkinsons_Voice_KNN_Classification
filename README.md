Project Overview

This project applies the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification model to predict health status (Parkinson’s vs. Healthy) from voice features. It also includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the model’s performance.
Files

    Parkinsons_Voice_KNN_Classification.ipynb: Contains the code for applying and optimizing the k-NN classifier.
    DB_Voice_Features.csv: The dataset used for the model.

Instructions

    Open the Jupyter Notebook.
    Ensure the dataset (DB_Voice_Features.csv) is in the same directory as the notebook.
    Run the cells to train, test, and optimize the k-NN model.
